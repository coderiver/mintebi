<h1>Domestic building systems (5/5)</h1>

<p>Grundfos is a world leader in pumps for small and mid-sized private homes. It's "red pump" is the preferred water and heating solution for most small-scale contractors, and the company enjoys a unique loyalty. </p>
<p>Key differentiating parameters for Grundfos in this segment are (i) reliability, (ii) energy efficiency, and (iii) ease of installation, and the vertical is it's most important business area accounting for approximately 50% of total sales.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Wilo is the closest competitor and together the two account for 70-80% of the European market. KSB is present across the whole spectrum, and also has significant sales in this segment .The company is also beginning to see some competition from lower-cost (primarily Asian) vendors including Guanghan, YIWU, CHANDAN and SHALi- MAR, which have led to price pressure.</li>
	<li>To stay ahead Grundfos needs to continually adapt to changes in the distribution network as an increased share is through online sales, and "pump streets" in Asian markets (clusters of pump retailers with minimum service and technical advice).
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Commercial building systems (3/5)</h1>

<p>Grundfos has gained a foothold in some industries, including hotels, hospitals and office buildings, and parts of the commercial building market - specially in The Nordics, Germany, US, UK and Eastern Europe. </p>

<ul>
	<li>The company has invested heavily in innovating it's products for this vertical, and have recently launched a product line of "intelligent" pumps with the in-line TPE3 as the flagship. The TPE3 has a built-in heat-energy-meter, and in general intelligent pumps are better at adapting to the system, thereby improving ROI and total cost of ownership as a selling point. </li>
	<li>The main challenge is that pumps is not a great priority for the the decision-maker that Grundfos typically faces - the consulting engineer, who specifies the design of the system that the pumps have to live up to and integrate with. The company therefore has some ground to cover in building up relations and creating attention about it's products' advantages. Both KSB and Wilo are competitors with a head start in this relation, while it is not a focus area for Pentair and Xylem. 
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Threats</h1>


<h2>Water Treatment (1/5)</h2>
<p>
Grundfos is a newcomer in the water systems vertical, which has been dominated by Xylem and Pentair for quite some time, delivering large-scale installations for industrial and public infrastructure projects. Deliveries include waste water-, and water treatment solutions, and pumps are only a part of an integrated system. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The customer's decision making process is more complicated and much different with politicians and other non-technical professionals being key stakeholders. Also many new projects are in Asia, where energy efficiency - one of Grundfos' key differentiating parameters - is less of a concern compared to application fit and a long term sustainable profile in the market. </li>
	<li>It is safe to say that the HQ in Bjerringbro is outside it's comfort zone and much more used to working with small-scale contractors and distributed large-scale to a big distribution network, mainly in Europe. This relate to both the product development offering and distribution, but Grundfos is dedicating many resources to this area as part of its greater "clean tech" ambitions. However, Pentair and Xylem continue to have a large advantage, while KSB also has a notable presence, and it is unlikely that Grundfos will succeed on a larger scale in the short term - in the medium term more likely if the company prioritise the right way.  
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Service offering (3/5)</h1>
<p>Grundfos demonstrates a relatively high performance in terms of the service it provides, and its strategy dictates that a “double-digit” percentage of earnings should come from this area in the future. The service offering includes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Service centres in about 50 countries worldwide provide for a strong local presence in all important markets. It's smaller competitors have a hard time matching this local presence and high service level. In terms of service, the impact from the about 600 "certified partners" worldwide is limited, as these are just its wholesalers and the certification is not that hard to get, even though it was recently updated. </li>
	<li>Grundfos Go - a mobile app for contractors providing helpful tools and advice on-the-go, including with respect to when-to-change and dimensioning of pumps. Go is an application of Grundfos' I-solutions system, that enable each pump to communicate through a wireless signal, eliminating the need to check every pump in case of system failure or low performance. Go can be downloaded for all lOS and Android devices, and is mostly relevant to commercial installations with many (Magna) pumps in the same system.</li>
	<li>Webcaps - an online specification tool for contractors and engineers. It includes CAD illustrations, full product documentation and, e.g., will tell the user what to install when an outdated product is to be replaced. A new and impressive Webcaps site was launched last year.</li>
	<li>Grundfos Ecademy - a free digital training tool and information platform that aim to keeps it's users up to date on latest developments within Grundfos and the pumping industry in general. Grundfos claims that the different e-learning programs are tailored to specific needs, but in reality it is quite "high level" in nature and some-what outdated. Most contractors with a real problem would likely go check out Youtube instead.</li>
	<li>In general Grundfos is widely recognised for a solid and stable service level compared to its peers, but it could do more for educating its partners. Also it should be mentioned that contractors in general do not use the products that much, and therefore general education is needed.   </li>

<h1>Product range (4/5)</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Grundfos is a full-range supplier across verticals and most pump applications, and the Alpha (for domestic use) and Magna (for commercial use) series are market leading "intelligent" pumps, a.a. due to a reduction in power consumption of up to 80% compared to competing products (the pump adapt its activity real time to usage in the system). However it lacks an offering within the very largest pump category, where it cannot match Pentair and Xylem, but these type of pumps account for only 2-5% of the total pump market.</li>
<li>A strong "demand more" innovation culture has given Grundfos' product development department a superior reputation, attracting leading engineers and product designers. This provides for a competitive edge, and has also helped it establish the position as a premium and innovative brand. The most important product differentiators thus continue to be ease of installation, innovation and product specialisation (Grundfos has a pump for almost every need) together with a well-earned reputation for its pumps that they are tough and never breaks down or fails, which are necessary to justify its premium prices.</li>
