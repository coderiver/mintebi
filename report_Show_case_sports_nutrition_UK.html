<h1>Key Findings</h1>

<h2>Key Growth Drivers:</h2>
<p>Last year (2014) the sale of sports nutrition in the UK grew more than 15%, driven by several new product launches in the convenience category, and extensive availability in super markets, which reflects a greater awareness among consumers. Despite a growing penetration, the market is not yet saturated and its value is expected to show high single-digit growth in the coming years. Key drivers are new consumers, including many women, and existing consumers trading up to more expensive products. Most of the growth will be in the form of other protein products as manufacturers are investing heavily in innovation for this category.</p>

<h1>Customers</h1>
<p>The consumer base is becoming broader and more segmented, and the traditional core users of sports nutrition, being elite athletes and bodybuilders, no longer dominate the landscape as they are giving way to two newer groups - the Health & Image users and the Casual users. </p>

<ul>
	<li>Core users include endurance athletes participating in marathons and triathlons, as well as the hard core weight lifters. Core users are highly critical about the product, which they purchase consistent. and focus on cutting-edge formula- lions and low cost-per-serving concentrates. While preferences obviously varies with the exercise regimen, core users typically share a familiarity with the science behind nutritional powders and shakes. These established sports nutrition consumers tend to care about functionality in addition to flavour. </li>
	<li>The health & image users view fitness as an important lifestyle component. They are brand-conscious experimenters, always up to date on health and wellness trends. These type of users associate themselves with active lifestyle branding, and tend to favour natural ingredients. The border between sports nutrition and general nutrition is more blurred for this group, and free-from, sustainability and animal welfare are unique selling points exploited by manufacturers.</li>
	<li>The casual users, frequently referred to as "weekend warriors", favour sports nutrition in convenient formats and with recognisable ingredients. They tend to be more easily affected by targeted marketing that highlights specific results such as improved mass, energy, endurance or weight loss. Unlike elite sports nutrition users, the amateur athlete does not know the science behind, and is therefore more prone to advertising. The recent years' evolving fitness trends have been driving supplement demand for this group.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although female athletes has been using sports nutrition for quite some time, the demand continues to be heavily male dominated accounting for more than 75% of sales. However in recent years more female users are using the supplements as they incorporate both high-intensity and weightlifting in their exercise regimen.</p>

<h1>Products & Services</h1>

<p>Sports nutrition products can generally be divided into protein products, and non-protein products, respectively.  </p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Non-protein products mainly takes the form of carbohydrate drinks, and typically contain; water, sugar in various forms, starch, minerals, colours and sweeteners. Caffeine is also found in a number of these products. High-end variants might be based on natural ingredients and contain sophisticated vitamin compounds to cater to health and image users in particular. Non-protein products generally do not contain any ingredients unique to sports nutrition.
		</li>
		<li>
		Protein products takes different forms; protein bars, powder, RTD (ready to drink) shakes and other protein. Powder continue to be the most prevalent protein-based sports nutrition, and is sold to be mixed with water or milk. Most powders are based on milk protein (whey protein and/or casein), but egg and soy protein are also fairly common. Powder products are sold in bulk, and mainly to established sports nutrition users.
		</li>
		<li>
		Protein bars and RTD shakes are more costly per gram of protein, and often represent more of an impulse purchase for consumers. Casual users find this protein source more appealing than large sacks of powder concentrate, partly due to years of stereotype advertisement by manufacturers.
		</li>
		<li>
		Expanding presence of other protein sources has largely been driven by food manufacturers promoting the broader bene-fits of protein. This tendency acts as a point of entry for consumers that are new to sports nutrition. As an example protein enhanced cereal and bread have become standard products at many regular food retailers.

	</li>
</ul>
<p>One general tendency is the growth in sales of sachets and smaller pack sizes to get people into the market, as consumers are afraid they will not like the flavour of the product. Flavour innovation is and will continue to be an important part of new product development.  </p>

<h1>Value proposition</h1>

<p>The purpose of sports nutrition consumption is very individual, but in general non-protein products are consumed to improve hydration, energy and recovery, while protein products are taken before workout to boost energy and as a post-exercise supple- ment for mass gain and muscle recovery. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Hydration is an important aspect of sports nutrition because of the loss of fluids and electrolytes when sweating during athletic activity. Sodium and potassium are the main electrolytes being lost in sweat, and both are necessary to regulate the body's fluid balance, which will therefore recover faster when drinking carbohydrate drinks containing these minerals. <br>Carbohydrates are the body's fuel and therefore necessary to maintain a high energy level during athletic activity. Fluids with a balanced carb-to-liquid ratio pass through the digestive system rapidly and feed the muscles with a small amount of carb fuel, increasing performance.
	</li>
		<li>
Protein is necessary to recover and grow muscle mass. An average adult male requires a daily intake of about 30-40 grams of protein per pound of body weight, but this varies greatly with the level and intensity of exercise. Endurance athletes thus typically needs between 0.5 and 0.7 grams per pound, while strength athletes can go as high as 0.8 grams per pound of bodyweight. These amounts, and the necessary complementary carb intake, can be difficult to get with a normal human diet. Protein-based sports nutrition products are used to fill this gap.
</li>
		<li>
Besides its functional effects, variations of sports nutrition are becoming more and more mainstream dietary components, and therefore begins to compete for consumers with traditional food and soft drink manufacturers. For the casual users in particular, flavour is an important selling point.
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Size & Growth</h1>
<h2>Estimated market value (total sales, current year):</h2>
<h2><strong>€530 millions</strong></h2>
<p>The UK market for sports nutrition has more than doubled within the past five years, and as of today its total annual sales amounts to approximately € 530m. Protein products account for about two thirds of the market, with protein powder alone driving more than 50% of this product group. These estimates are based on my personal industry experience, but are all well-known within the industry. The euro market value was converted from a GBP value of ca. 380m.</p>
<h2>Expected 4-year CAGR:</h2>
<h2><strong>+7% </strong></h2>
<p>Last year (2014) the sale of sports nutrition in the UK grew more than 15%, driven by several new product launches in the convenience category, and extensive availability in super markets, which reflects a greater awareness among consumers. Despite a growing penetration the market is not yet saturated and its value is expected to show high single-digit growth in the coming years. Key drivers are new consumers, including many women, and existing consumers trading up to more expenses products. Most of the growth will be in the form of other protein products as manufacturers are investing heavily in innovation for this category, which is trending already and will continue to get stronger over the coming years. Especially niche protein sources such as pea and canola based protein should be monitored with interest. </p>
