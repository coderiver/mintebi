<h1>Competitive Landscape Report</h1>
<h2>Client Brief</h2>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Key players fighting for dominance in the global cloud services market </td>
		<td>	I need to understand the current situation in the global Infrastructure as a Service (laaS) cloud market. More specifically I want (i) a description of each of the key players prerequisites for succeeding in the market, (ii) their ability to execute, and (iii) to get a better understanding of the dy-namics of the ongoing battle between Amazon and Google. I am unable to define the two parameters that should make up the landscape, but I guess that ability to execute could be one of them.

<p>-ups that wanted to pay for servers by the hour, instead of renting them individually as was typical at the time. Amazon already had a significant cloud capacity, in terms of the data centers on which it was running amazon.com, and started renting out parts of it at low prices, this being the foundation of its cloud business Amazon Web Services (“AWS” or just “Amazon” in this report)</p>
<p>Because Amazon was pricing its services aggressively right from the beginning, the company quickly came to define the market for cloud computing and storage and has grown into an absolute market leader - Amazon's entire public cloud is larger than the rest of the providers' combined, and that includes Google. This has trans-lated into a market share of 28% (The Economist, April 2015).</p>
<p>Besides its head start and strong position, Amazon enjoys another advantage to the late-comers; to use a cloud service, the local computer needs a common language to communicate with the servers in the cloud. No such language existed back then, so Amazon had to invent one of its own, and created an application programming interface (API) - an architecture that have since become widespread. The primary Amazon cloud technology, EC2, is now far ahead of competing technologies in terms of implementations, and with the exception of Snapchat, the companies that rely heavily on cloud services are almost all customers of Amazon. As clients have integrated the Amazon API in their own applications, switching costs are high, effectively protecting its customer base.

<h1>Level of competition</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Current: Competition is tough</li>
	<li>In three years: Competition will increase</li>
</ul>
<p>Amazon and Google are in an epic battle to dominate the cloud, and in March this year Google announced price cuts that would make its cloud services cheaper than Amazon. However Amazon quickly lowered prices in responses, putting the price levels more or less at par. In fact Amazon has lowered their prices in absolute terms more than 40 times since its first offering of cloud services. This downward spiral is likely to increase as the competition between Google and AWS is more than about the cloud market, - they both have a mission to get the lion’ share of the total corporate-IT market, which represents a much larger potential, for which dominance in the cloud is a key to success. As the profits convert to zero, smaller (and less efficient) players in the market will have a hard time in competing at scale, while those who have the muscle, including IBM and Microsoft, will have to keep prices low but might extract some premium from their long term entrenchment with (larger) corporate customers. </p>
