<h1>Strengths</h1>
<h2>Integrated ecosystem of products and services</h2> 
<p>Apple has a unique composition of media consumption devices and services that make up an ecosystem its competitors have a hard time matching. The company has always taken a holistic approach to the full consumer experience, re-suiting in an ecosystem around its core products, including both hardware, content and services. This close integration creates a synergistic environment from an end-user perspective, and guarantees a high cross-device performance.</p>


<h2>Strong brand preference </h2>
<p>This ecosystem and its high usability locks consumers within it, making the switch to another platform somewhat in-convenient, amplified by a relatively limited number of alternative solutions. In addition, Apple's widespread recognition as a premium brand makes its users less willing to "downgrade" to other vendors, and spurs sales in emerging markets where many middle class consumers see Apple devices as a sign of personal success. </p>


<h2>High technological discipline </h2>
<p>Despite frequent and major software updates since the launch of the first iPhone in 2007, the iOS operating system has adhered to the same core structure, thereby maintaining familiarity among its users. The company's products are con-tinuously among the most user friendly, focusing on simplicity in operation and key performance features such as bat-tery life. Combined with an ergonomic and minimalistic design, this consistence is a significant advantage for Apple. </p>

<h1>Weaknesses</h1>

<h2>Limited product portfolio </h2>
<p>Apple has been able to maintain high margins with a narrow product range but this has left it prone to risks from changes in consumer preferences. Despite the introduction of Apple Pay and the Apple Watch, the company will in the short to medium term continue to rely heavily on the sale of smartphones and tablets. In comparison, a key competitor such as Samsung offers a much wider product portfolio, including TV's and home appliances. </p>


<h2>Limited price range presence </h2>
<p>Apple’s products are priced higher than alternatives from competing brands, and the company has no budget range product lines, which limits its addressable segment. Android powered devices spans multiple brands, and offers more price points and form factors thereby appealing to a larger audience than the iPad and iPhone. Going forward, the majority of new tablet buyers, many in emerging markets, are thus expected to go for Android solutions.  </p>


<h2>Lack of explorative innovation </h2>
<p>Just as Apple’s technology discipline is an advantage in terms of user experience, it also sets natural boundaries for the company to introduce ground breaking new technologies. The iOS operating system is based primarily on in-house development, with less room for third party developers to use it as a “playground”. For comparison, Google (and its Android platform) is much more dependent on a network of contracted developers, and thus more likely to incorporate new ideas in early phases.</p>
<h1>Opportunities</h1>


<h2>Wearable electronics and data </h2>
<p>Initial reviews of the Apple Watch have been relatively modest, but 5-10% of about 400 million iPhone users claim they intend to purchase an Apple Watch. The wearables market will be driven by early adopters in developed markets, where Apple enjoys a strong position. In the longer term, it also opens up for the largely unexplored contextual computing market, referring to the collection, use and sharing of personal data to provide users with a digital "personal assistant”. </p>


<h2>Platform expansion </h2>
<p>This ecosystem and its high usability locks consumers within it, making the switch to another platform somewhat in-convenient, amplified by a relatively limited number of alternative solutions. In addition, Apple's widespread recognition as a premium brand makes its users less willing to "downgrade" to other vendors, and spurs sales in emerging markets where many middle class consumers see Apple devices as a sign of personal success. </p>


<h2>The enterprise market </h2>
<p>While growth in b-to-c tablet sales started to stagnate last year, the enterprise market poses an interesting opportunity to Apple's iPad sales. A key driver for this trend is the use of cloud computing services among businesses, creating demand for simpler more portable devices as storage and processing is handled in the cloud. At the same time, various governments, including in emerging market countries, are implementing tablets in the educational sector. </p>

<h1>Threats</h1>


<h2>Rival smart phone vendors </h2>
<p>Smartphones have over the past 3-4 years become mainstream communication devices globally, largely thanks to de- creasing prices for entry level models. With sales of budget-, and mid-priced smartphones gaining traction, Apple is competing with a growing club of vendors with an increasingly attractive product portfolio. As developed markets are saturated, this puts pressure on Apple's market share and ability to maintain high margins. </p>


<h2>Declining tablet market </h2>
<p>Last year iPad sales declined for two quarters in a row, and without a significant renewal of the model line-up this trend should be expected to continue. The consumer tablet market in developed countries is increasingly saturated, and Apple does not have economy-priced tablets to reap the benefits of increasing demand for this type in emerging markets such as China.</p>


<h2>Google </h2>
<p>As Apple is entering the wearable devices market, it is also entering the contextual computing market. This poses a huge potential, but Apple’s success will ultimately depend on its ability to collect and apply user data, which means it will be competing head to head with Google, who already has a strong position in this area. Apple will need to expand its online services platform, and should hope that Google does not find a way to create more synergies with its device makers.</p>

<h1>Expected 3-year development</h1>

<h2>Sales CAGR: 15%</h2>
<p>Total sales CAGR of +15-16%, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>+20% for iPhones</li>
<li>-10-15% for tablets</li>
<li>+2-3% for Mac (desktops and laptops)</li>
<li>5-10% for other categories including software and services</li>
<li>Contribution of USD 15-20bn in sales from wearables/Apple Watch (from currently zero)</li>
</ul>

<h2>EBITDA-margin: Will remain the same</h2>
<p>Apple currently delivers an EBITDA-margin of 33% (annual report, 2014) which is expected to be maintained at roughly the same level, with an upside in the point-something range. This estimate very much depends on Apple’s ability to continue to extract premium prices, as it has not cultivated any real cost-cutting culture. In addition, sale of Apple Watches is likely to be a high-margin business, as the competitive intensity in this segment (at least for now) continues to be limited. The services segment represents an upside with Apple Music if the company is able to settle reasonably in terms of artists’ royalties and scale across devices on its current user base, and thereby become what long time incumbent, Spotify, has never really been - profitable. </p>

<h2>Market share: Apple will gain market shares</h2>
<p>The global consumer electronics market is expected to grow 2-3% per year in the coming years, according a.o. to the US Consumer Electronics Association (https://www.ce.org/Research/Products-Services/Industry-Sales-Data.aspx) and PR Newswire (http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-consumer-electronics-market-outlook-2020---asia-pacific-is-propelling-the-consumer-electronics-industry-504375261.html). Compared to this, Apple’s expected double-digit growth means it is likely to gain market share overall. Within the critical smart-phone segment Apple will see its 65% market share increase despite a continued decline when measured in units (with a current level of 18%). Within the computer/tablet segment it should hope to maintain its current share by appealing to brand focused and increasingly wealthy consumers, increase penetration in the enterprise segment, and not be stuck in the middle between cheaper alternatives and more expensive hybrids (laptop & tablet in one). </p>
